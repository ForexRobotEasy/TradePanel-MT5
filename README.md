## Code Explanation

The provided code demonstrates how to use the TradePanel MT5 in a trading algorithm. Here is a breakdown of the code and its functionality:

1. Import necessary modules: The TradePanel.mqh module is imported to access the TradePanel class and its functions.

2. Initialize trade panel object: An instance of the TradePanel class is created and assigned to the variable `panel`.

3. Define trading algorithm: The `OnTick()` function is used to define the trading algorithm. It retrieves real-time trading results using the TradePanel object's functions `GetAccountBalance()`, `GetAccountEquity()`, and `GetAccountProfit()`. The results are then printed using the `Print()` function.

4. Initialize TradePanel MT5: The `OnInit()` function is called when the program starts. It sets up advanced trading tools, such as charts, indicators, and risk management, using the TradePanel object's functions `SetupCharts()`, `SetupIndicators()`, and `SetupRiskManagement()`. It also adds download options for desktop and mobile using the `AddDownloadOption()` function. Integration with MetaTrader 5 is established using the `IntegrateWithMetaTrader5()` function. Customization options are enabled using the `EnableCustomization()` function. Real-time market data is obtained using the `GetRealTimeMarketData()` function. Independent testing is allowed using the `AllowIndependentTesting()` function.

5. Clean up resources: The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the program ends. It cleans up resources by calling the TradePanel object's `Cleanup()` function.

6. Logical conclusion of the program: The second `OnDeinit()` function is called when the program ends. It also cleans up resources by calling the TradePanel object's `Cleanup()` function and prints a message indicating that TradePanel MT5 has been closed.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and may require additional modifications and customizations to suit specific trading strategies.
